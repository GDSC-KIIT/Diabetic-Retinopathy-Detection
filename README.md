# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

This repo is accepting contributions under HacktoberFest 2022 thanks to the initiative by GDSC x iNeuron. 

The detection of DR can be executed using these images, along with defining the stage at which the condition is in any patient at any given time. When implemented in an accessible system, this very feature can let a patient know of the severity and urgently advise them to take subsequent necessary steps.
